# Statistics Lecture Notebooks

This is an ipython/jupyter notebook for a lecture about Hypothesis
Testing and Posterior Inference.  It has interactive exercises
imbedded, so it is expected the students will have the same notebook
available to them. (Possible change: Maybe have an "answers" one separate).
